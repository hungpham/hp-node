The example is also helpful with the exercises below. However, rather than coding raw JavaScript, it is highly recommended that you leverage flow control  modules (nimble or async) in your homework.

Exercise 1
    Given an array of 10 URLs of images from the Internet. Write an application that sequentially downloads each of the images to your local directory.
Exercise 2
    Modify the code from Exercise #1 so that the app downloads the files in parallel
Exercise 3
    Use console.time() and console.timeEnd() to measure the time spent on sequential and parallel downloading. Conclude on the efficiency of the two methods.
Hint: Bonus if you can also measure memory and CPU consumption in either case :)
